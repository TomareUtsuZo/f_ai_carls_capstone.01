# üìù PROJECT SPECIFICATION TEMPLATE
## Project Overview
Working title: AI Carls Capstone Project

One-sentence summary: This project is a capstone for AI development, focusing on integrating real-time and batch data pipelines for advanced analytics.

Business/value objective: The goal is to build a scalable data processing system that enhances decision-making through efficient data handling and analysis.

Success metrics (quantitative): Key metrics include processing time under 5 seconds for real-time data and 95% accuracy in batch analytics.

## Problem & Scope
Problem statement and constraints: This project addresses challenges in handling heterogeneous data sources with constraints like real-time latency and data volume limits.

Personas/stakeholders and primary use cases: Primary users are data engineers and analysts; use cases include real-time monitoring and periodic reporting.

    In/out of scope: In scope: Data pipeline implementation; out of scope: Full UI development.

## Data Sources
    Real-time source: [API name, endpoint, data format, update frequency] - feeds into real-time pipeline

    Batch source: [Dataset name, format, volume, update cadence] - feeds into batch pipeline

    Why 2 different sources: [Brief explanation of why you need both real-time and batch data]
